Welcome to ZK-NFT-Clash, a game made during the ethglobal online hackathon, using zero knowledge, and Keynesian beauty contest! In this game, you will compete against other players in a clash of wits and strategy, using your NFTs and zero knowledge proofs to outsmart your opponents and emerge victorious.

Zero knowledge proofs ensure that your moves and strategies remain hidden from prying eyes. And with the Keynesian beauty contest mechanic, you'll need to not only outsmart your opponents, but also predict what they will do and choose the most popular move to win.
