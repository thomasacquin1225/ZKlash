Welcome to ZK-NFT-Clash, a game made during the ethglobal online hackathon, the ultimate PvP game based on EIP-6551, zero knowledge, and Keynesian beauty contest! In this game, you will compete against other players in a clash of wits and strategy, using your NFTs and zero knowledge proofs to outsmart your opponents and emerge victorious.

With EIP-6551, you can be sure that your NFTs are secure and tamper-proof, while zero knowledge proofs ensure that your moves and strategies remain hidden from prying eyes. And with the Keynesian beauty contest mechanic, you'll need to not only outsmart your opponents, but also predict what they will do and choose the most popular move to win.

So what are you waiting for? Join the ZK-NFT-Clash community today and prove your skills as the ultimate PvP champion!
